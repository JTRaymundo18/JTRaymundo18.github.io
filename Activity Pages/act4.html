                This handheld gaming device became a huge sensation as it was officially announced by Steam, which was globally released on February 25, 2022, 
                It is definitely impressive that Valve's valiant attempt to create a device that is capable of running your games outside of your casual Gaming PC
                is every gamer's dream. You don't have to worry about missing out on your daily quests of your favorite games, and be able to enjoy as much as you would
                when playing in your PC. Aside from this, you can also link your Steam Library to the Steam Deck so you can play your favorite games whenever and wherever you want!

                Additionally, the Steam Deck features a desktop mode and allows users to install third-party Linux applications. The device has seen multiple revisions, 
                including the introduction of OLED screen models in November 2023. Despite criticism regarding battery life, the Steam Deck has achieved notable commercial success,
                selling millions of units and influencing the market with its approach to portable gaming, and has spurred interest in similar handheld gaming computers. 
                It is widely available to most regions such as the United States, Europe, Canada, and some countries in Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
                Although there are some game stores that sells this device, Steam Deck is not widely recognized in the markets of the Philippines and other countries, and cannot be delivered from other country as it must be pruchased in the same region.
