                                        grouping the
                                        elements as metals and
                                        nonmetals.</mark>
                                    Forty years later, <mark>German physicist Johann Wolfang Döbereiner observed
                                        similarities in
                                        physical and
                                        chemical properties of certain elements. He arranged them in groups of three in
                                        increasing order of
                                        atomic weight and called them triads, </mark> observing that some properties of
                                    the
                                    middle element, such as
                                    atomic weight and density, approximated the average value of these properties in the
                                    other
                                    two in
                                    each triad.

                                    A breakthrough came with the publication of a revised list of elements and their
                                    atomic
                                    masses at
                                    the first international conference of chemistry in Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1860. They
                                    concluded that
                                    hydrogen would be assigned the atomic weight of 1 and the atomic weight of other
                                    elements
                                    would be
                                    decided by comparison with hydrogen. For example, carbon, being 12 times heavier
                                    than
                                    hydrogen, would
                                    have an atomic weight of 12.

                                    <mark>British chemist John Newlands was the first to arrange the elements into a
                                        periodic
                                        table with
                                        increasing order of atomic masses. He found that every eight elements had
                                        similar
                                        properties and
                                        called this the law of octaves.</mark> He arranged the elements in eight groups
                                    but left
                                    no gaps for
                                    undiscovered elements.

                                        the framework that became the modern
                                        periodic
                                        table, leaving gaps for elements that were yet to be discovered. While arranging
                                        the elements
                                        according to their atomic weight,</mark>if he found that they did not fit into

                                    rearrange them. Mendeleev predicted the properties of some undiscovered elements and
                                    gave them
                                    names
                                    such as "eka-aluminium" for an element with properties similar to aluminium. Later
                                    eka-aluminium
                                    was
                                    discovered as gallium. Some discrepancies remained; the position of certain
                                    elements, such as
                                    iodine
                                    and tellurium, could not be explained.

                                    German chemist Lothar Meyer produced a version of the periodic table similar to
                                    Mendeleev’s in
                                    1870.
                                    He left gaps for undiscovered elements but never predicted their properties. The

                                    London awarded the Davy Medal in 1882 to both Mendeleev and Meyer. The later

                                    elements
                                    predicted by Mendeleev, including gallium (1875), scandium (1879) and germanium

                                    predictions and his periodic table won universal recognition. In 1955 the 101st

                                    <mark>Henry Moseley used X-rays to measure the wavelengths of elements and

                                    UNESCO named 2019 the International Year of the Periodic Table to mark the 150th
                                    anniversary of
                                    Mendeleev’s publication. Researchers and teachers worldwide took this opportunity to
                                    reflect on
                                    the importance of the periodic table and spread awareness about it in classrooms and
                                    beyond.
                                    Workshops and conferences encouraged people to use the knowledge of the periodic
                                    table
                                    to solve

                                    in health, technology, agriculture, environment and education. Publication houses
                                    organized monthly

                                    tours.
                                    These initiatives demonstrated how the elements are integral to our daily lives in
                                    medicines,
                                    pesticides and lithium batteries.

                                    On its website marking the celebration, UNESCO wrote, “The Periodic Table of
